Library for working with encrypted data within nilDB queries and replies.

## Description and Purpose

This library provides cryptographic operations that are compatible with nilDB nodes and clusters, allowing developers to leverage certain privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) when storing, operating upon, and retrieving data while working with nilDB. The table below summarizes the functionalities available in nilQL.

| Cluster        | Operation  | Implementation Details                            | Supported Types                                   |
|----------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| single node    | store      | XSalsa20 stream cipher and Poly1305 MAC           | 32-bit signed integer; UTF-8 string (<4097 bytes) |
| single node    | match      | deterministic salted hashing via SHA-512          | 32-bit signed integer; UTF-8 string (<4097 bytes) |
| single node    | sum        | non-deterministic Paillier with 2048-bit primes   | 32-bit signed integer                             |
| multiple nodes | store      | XOR-based secret sharing                          | 32-bit signed integer; UTF-8 string (<4097 bytes) |
| multiple nodes | match      | deterministic salted hashing via SHA-512          | 32-bit signed integer; UTF-8 string (<4097 bytes) |
| multiple nodes | sum        | additive secret sharing (prime modulus 2^32 + 15) | 32-bit signed integer                             |

## Package Installation and Usage

The package can be installed using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```shell
pnpm install
```

The library can be imported in the usual way:

```ts
import { nilql } from "@nillion/nilql";
```

An example demonstrating use of the library is presented below:

```ts
const cluster = {"nodes": [{}, {}]};
const secretKey = await nilql.SecretKey.generate(cluster, {"sum": true});
const plaintext = BigInt(123);
const ciphertext = await nilql.encrypt(secretKey, plaintext);
const decrypted = await nilql.decrypt(secretKey, ciphertext);
console.log(plaintext, decrypted); // Should output `123n 123n`.
```

## Testing and Conventions

All unit tests are executed and their coverage measured with [vitest](https://vitest.dev/):

```shell
pnpm test
```

Style conventions are enforced using [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/):

```shell
pnpm lint
```

Types are checked with:

```shell
pnpm typecheck
```

The distribution files are checked with:
