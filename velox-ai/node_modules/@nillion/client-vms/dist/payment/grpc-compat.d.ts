/**
 * This wrapper maintains API compatibility with the cosmjs library while using `@bufbuild/protobuf`.
 * It bridges the gap between different protobuf implementations during the migration from
 * protobufjs to `@bufbuild/protobuf` and from the cluster's migration from libp2p to gRPC.
 *
 * Only `encode` and `fromPartial` methods are implemented as they are sufficient for sending transactions.
 *
 * We use `@ts-expect-error` because `TsProtoGeneratedType` expects `protobuf.Writer/Reader`,
 * but we're using `BinaryWriter/Reader`. The methods used are compatible between these types,
 * allowing us to bypass the type check safely in this context.
